# Adaptive Audience Presentation

Tailor communication, presentation, and framing to specific audiences, speaking to each in their own "language" - cultural, professional, and personal.

---

## When to Use

- Presenting the same idea to different stakeholder groups
- Communicating across cultural or professional boundaries
- Managing message consistency while adapting to audience
- Navigating multi-stakeholder situations with competing perspectives
- Any situation requiring different frames for different groups

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| core_message | Yes | The essential content or proposition to communicate |
| audiences | Yes | The different groups who need to receive this message |
| outcomes_needed | No | What you need each audience to do or believe |
| constraints | No | What must remain consistent across all presentations |

---

## The Five-Step Framework

### Step 1: Define the Invariant Core

Before adapting, identify what cannot change:
- The essential truth of your message
- Commitments you must keep consistent
- Facts that cannot be presented differently
- Your authentic values and identity

**Cleopatra's insight:** "I was Greek to Greeks and Egyptian to Egyptians, but I was always Cleopatra. Adaptation is not deception - it is translation. The substance remains; the presentation transforms."

### Step 2: Map Each Audience

For each audience, understand:
- **Values:** What do they care about most?
- **Language:** What terminology and references resonate?
- **Concerns:** What worries them about your proposition?
- **Decision criteria:** What would make them say yes?
- **Cultural context:** What frames and approaches feel natural to them?

**Key question:** If this audience were telling a friend about your proposition, what would they say?

### Step 3: Identify the Translation Points

Where your core message needs adaptation:
- **Emphasis:** Which aspects matter most to this audience?
- **Framing:** What context makes this relevant to them?
- **Language:** What words carry the right connotations?
- **Evidence:** What type of proof convinces them?
- **Benefits:** Which outcomes resonate with their values?

### Step 4: Design Audience-Specific Presentations

For each audience, create:
- Opening frame that speaks to their concerns
- Key points emphasized in order of their priorities
- Language and terminology they use naturally
- Evidence types they find credible
- Call to action that aligns with their decision process

### Step 5: Plan for Consistency

Ensure that:
- No audience receives contradictory facts
- If audiences compare notes, the core is consistent
- Your credibility survives cross-audience communication
- Adaptations are in presentation, not substance

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Output Format

```markdown
## Adaptive Audience Presentation

### Core Message (Invariant)
[The essential truth that all presentations share]

### Audience Analysis

#### Audience 1: [Name]
| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Values | ... |
| Language | ... |
| Concerns | ... |
| Decision criteria | ... |
| Cultural context | ... |

**Adapted presentation:**
- **Opening:** [Specific opening for this audience]
- **Key emphasis:** [What to stress]
- **Language choices:** [Specific terms to use/avoid]
- **Evidence type:** [What proves your point to them]
- **Call to action:** [What you ask of them]

#### Audience 2: [Name]
[Same structure]

### Consistency Check
| Element | Audience 1 | Audience 2 | Consistent? |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Core facts | ... | ... | Yes/No |
| Commitments | ... | ... | Yes/No |

### If Audiences Compare Notes
[What would happen if they talked to each other; how to ensure coherence]
```

---

## Constraints

- Adaptations must be in presentation, not substance
- Never make contradictory promises to different audiences
- Maintain your authentic identity across presentations
- Consider the risk of audiences comparing notes
- Respect each audience's intelligence - adaptation is not manipulation

---

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Example

**Input:** "I'm proposing a new AI initiative. I need to present to: (1) the engineering team who will build it, (2) the executive team who will fund it, and (3) the legal/compliance team who will evaluate risk. Same initiative, very different audiences. How do I approach each?"

**Output:**

## Adaptive Audience Presentation

### Core Message (Invariant)
We have an opportunity to implement AI capabilities that will improve [specific business outcome]. The approach is technically sound, strategically valuable, and can be implemented responsibly. We should move forward with a phased approach.

### Audience Analysis

#### Audience 1: Engineering Team
| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Values | Technical excellence, interesting problems, autonomy, realistic timelines |
| Language | Specific technologies, architecture decisions, technical tradeoffs |
| Concerns | "Is this technically feasible?" "Will we get the resources we need?" "Is this actually interesting?" |
| Decision criteria | Technical soundness, clear requirements, reasonable scope |
| Cultural context | Skeptical of "business speak," respect demonstrated technical understanding |

**Adapted presentation:**
- **Opening:** "I want to walk through the technical approach and get your input on feasibility before we commit to anything."
- **Key emphasis:** Architecture decisions, technology choices, technical challenges, why this is interesting
- **Language choices:** Use specific technical terms; avoid business jargon like "synergy" or "leverage"
- **Evidence type:** Technical diagrams, proof of concepts, benchmarks, comparable implementations
- **Call to action:** "What technical concerns do you see? What would you need to feel confident building this?"

#### Audience 2: Executive Team
| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Values | ROI, competitive advantage, strategic alignment, manageable risk |
| Language | Business outcomes, timelines, investment, competitive landscape |
| Concerns | "What's the business case?" "How does this compare to other priorities?" "What's the risk?" |
| Decision criteria | Clear ROI, strategic fit, reasonable investment, risk mitigation |
| Cultural context | Limited time, need bottom-line clarity, want confidence not details |

**Adapted presentation:**
- **Opening:** "This initiative addresses [business problem] and positions us ahead of competitors. Here's the investment case."
- **Key emphasis:** Business outcomes, competitive timing, ROI projections, risk management
- **Language choices:** Business impact, market position, return on investment, strategic alignment
- **Evidence type:** Market data, competitor analysis, financial projections, case studies from peer companies
- **Call to action:** "I'm asking for [specific investment] to capture this opportunity before [competitive window]."

#### Audience 3: Legal/Compliance Team
| Dimension | Analysis |
|-----------|----------|
| Values | Risk mitigation, regulatory compliance, organizational protection, clear accountability |
| Language | Compliance requirements, liability, governance, audit trails |
| Concerns | "What could go wrong?" "Are we exposed?" "How do we maintain compliance?" |
| Decision criteria | Clear risk mitigation, regulatory alignment, documented governance |
| Cultural context | Job is to find problems; expect to be skeptical; want thoroughness |

**Adapted presentation:**
- **Opening:** "I want to walk you through our approach to responsible AI implementation and get your guidance on governance structure."
- **Key emphasis:** Risk identification, compliance approach, governance model, documentation practices
- **Language choices:** Regulatory compliance, risk mitigation, governance framework, audit capabilities
- **Evidence type:** Compliance checklists, governance documentation, industry standards alignment, risk assessments
- **Call to action:** "What compliance requirements should we address? What governance structure would give you confidence?"

### Consistency Check
| Element | Engineering | Executive | Legal | Consistent? |
|---------|------------|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Project scope | Full technical detail | Summary | Risk-relevant | Yes - same scope, different detail |
| Timeline | Technical milestones | Business milestones | Compliance milestones | Yes - same timeline, different emphasis |
| Investment ask | Resource requirements | Dollar amount | Compliance budget | Yes - same investment |
| Risk acknowledgment | Technical risks | Business risks | Legal risks | Yes - same risks, different categories |

### If Audiences Compare Notes
All three presentations reference the same initiative with the same scope, timeline, and investment. If they compare notes, they would see that engineering got technical depth, executives got business case, and legal got risk analysis - appropriate translations of the same proposal. No contradictions, just emphasis differences.
